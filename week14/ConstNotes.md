    What you learned & how you would use the concept taught in a real-world application

        The following is a summary report on the UofM Bootcamp class on the 12th of July 2018.  This course was an introduction to the use of constructors in javascript coding.  Constructors are ways to create objects, or create New objects based on a baisc template. Since JavaScript doesn't support classes, it utilizes constructors to bring similar functionality to that of object oriented programming languages such as Java.  Working with constructors is simmilar to objects but provides its own set of coding challendges while providing new and varrious real world use cases
       
        We started with reviewing objects by creating a new object named Cats and named Dogs to demonstrate how to call objects and how they all perform very similiar. THen we demonstrated the power o constructors to help us create new objects based on a the contruct.  With our new understanding of how constructors are utilized in Javascript we coded an example RPG game which allows the user to create new charactures based on the constructor, then utilize several functions to have the new charactures fight.

        Chalenges included how to debug our code as we worked to create it.  Unlike HTML and CSS which we can make small changes and see the result in the browser, backed javascript run on node does not always produce an output as most of the code is functions and object which need to be called (additinoal code) to be run.  

        A constructor is useful in many ways when utlized in Javascript.  A constructor allows for real code design by splitting the defining and creation of objects into seperate js files.  By doing this code can be blocked into smaller units which makes implimatation and modifcation easier.  Almost all website code utilizes constructors to some degree in this way including website creation and hosting site such as wordpress as well as more social media sites such as Facebook.
