//As a best practice, sketch out the architecture of your application before you start writing code.

//For this exercise, start by describing what your application does. Do this in a bullet list.

//Next, decide how you might divvy up these responsibilities. Would you write a single module that handles all of them? Would you write one module for each bullet list? Something else? Be sure to justify your decision.

//Finally, draw a diagram describing the flow of your application. Donâ€™t worry about being too precise here, but include enough detail where you can use it as a guide to explain it to someone else. You can do this either by using pencil and paper or flowchart generation software like draw.io.

//Take a moment to study the GIF below if stuck. Remember that this application also prints the logged data to a file named log.txt.
