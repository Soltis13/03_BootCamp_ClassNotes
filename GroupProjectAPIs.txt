    API Reference : Resources
    The Browse API has the following resources:

    item_summary: Lets shoppers search for specific items by keyword, GTIN, category, product, or item aspects and refine the results by using filters.
    item: Lets you retrieve the details of a specific item or all the items in an item group, which is an item with variations such as color and size. This resource also provides a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Trading and Finding, and the RESTful APIs, such as Browse, which use different formats for the item IDs. You can use the Browse API to retrieve the basic details of the item and the RESTful item ID using a legacy item ID.
