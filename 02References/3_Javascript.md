## Notes on the use of Javascript and jQuery for web design.

### Programming

    Start with the big picture and planning
        1. Define the Goal
        2. Design the Script (sudoCode)
        3. Code Each Step
    
    Computers model the world on data

        Objects ( the Things)

        Properties ( The Characturistics)

        Events (triggers to do something)

        Methods (things done with or to the objects)
    
    Web Browsers are programs with these objects/properties/events/methods to allow users to interact

    calling a method of an object

        document.write('Something')  - looks to write Something into the webpage which is te top level or document
    

### Basic Javascript

    Variables - place to store a bit of information

        var number / string / boolian

    Array - a variable that stores mulitple values.

        var array = ['0','1']


### Functions, Methods, & Objects

    Function - a group or series of statments made together to perform a specific task.

        function sayHello() {

        }
    
        can return multiple values through use of an array.

    Object - a grouping of variabales and functions

        var obj = {}
        var newvar = object.name;

        object.name = Park;  -(update the object with name)
        object['name'] = Park;

        this - (keyword used in an object to refer to tht object)

        Built in Objects
