# **Instructions**

* Make a dogs object with three keys...
var dog = {
  'raining': true,
  'noise': "Woof woof",
  makeNoise: function() {
    console.log(this.noise)
  }
}


  * First key called "raining" with a value of true

* Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

* Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

* Make a cats object with three keys...

var cats = {
  'raining': false,
  'noise': "Meow!"
  makeNoise: function() {
    console.log(this.noise)
  }
}
  * First key called "raining" with a value of false

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark
dog.makeNoise()

* Make the cat meow
cat.makeNoise()

* BONUS: Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.

* BONUS: Look to see if you can find any means to simplify your code further and further
